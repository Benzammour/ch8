## About The Project

In my attempt to learn more C and get my feet wet with Emulator Development I started writing a Gameboy Emulator...which ended in this project.
Realizing that the Gameboy was too ambitious initially I started **cretro**, a fully featured chip 8 emulator which also includes keybindings and sound.

[Here is the Emulator running snake!](https://github.com/Benzammour/cretro/blob/feature/add-readme/.github/images/snake.gif)

## Getting Started

As this project uses Linux/POSIX APIs, namely `pthread.h` and `sys/time.h` the project will only work on Linux right now.
However, if you are using Windows, using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) works fine.

### Prerequisites

This project uses gcc, make and SDL2. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

On Debian-based systems you can run the following to install the dependencies
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev make
```

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benzammour/cretro.git
   ```
2. Build the Project
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

To run a ROM, pass the path into `cretro`, right after your configured clock-delay (in milliseconds):

```bash
   ./cretro <DELAY> <PATH>
```

An example would be 
```bash
   ./cretro 0 roms/bat.ch8
```
To initially test the emulator, I created the [bat.ch8](https://github.com/Benzammour/cretro/blob/feature/add-readme/roms/bat.ch8) ROM for you:
